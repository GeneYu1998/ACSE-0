# ACSE 0 Python Exercises

## Deadline: 9th October 12:00 BST

Lectures 1-4 are Jupyter notebooks containing exercises tested using a package called `okpy`.

You may need to run the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to install the `okpy` package.

1. Complete all the exercises in each of these notebooks.
2. Add each of these **completed** notebooks to this repository for uploading to github classroom using the filenames `lecture1.ipynb`, `lecture2.ipynb`, `lecture3.ipynb`, `lecture4.ipynb`.
3. The grading is automated so you **must** use these filenames. Do not add any additional files. Do not add any additional folders.
4. You can submit multiple times. Only your final version pushed to github classroom before the deadline will be graded.


You will notice that okpy reports your score in the exercises so you can assess yourself. While this grade will not count towards your final Masters classification, you should aim to get 100% in this first assessment to demonistrate a basic level of programming ability with Python.

**Top tip: Restart the notebook kernel and re-run the entire notebook to ensure it all works correctly.** Students frequently submit notebooks that are in an inconsistent state!
